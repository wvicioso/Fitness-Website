			<p>Is the gym a foreign land to you? Do workout routines make no sense to you? After you get through this page you will never again walk into a gym and think "I have no idea what I'm doing"<p>
		&nbsp;
		<h2>How Do I Gym?<h2>
			<p>To gym correctly, you first need to understand how the muscles of your body work. Its actually pretty simple. All of your muscles make one of two possible motions. They either <em>PUSH</em> or <em>PULL</em>.
		&nbsp;
		<article>
		<h2>Muscles That Push</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Chest</li>
				<li>Shoulders</li>
				<li>Triceps</li>
			</ul>
		&nbsp;
		<h2>Muscles That Pull</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Biceps</li>
				<li>Back</li>
				<li>Forearms</li>
			</ul>
		</article>
		&nbsp;
			<p>The idea is to work out groups of muscles together. Do pulling exercises one day and do pushing exercises</p>
		&nbsp;
		<h2>What about Legs?</h2>
			<p>One word. Sqauts.</p>
		&nbsp;
		<h2>Abs?</h2>
			<p>Most workouts require use of your core already but if you insist, sit-ups and crunches.</p>
		&nbsp;
		<h2>So. . . Can I Gym Now?</h2>
			<p>Almost. You now know the fundementals. Now we're going to incorperate everything we have learned into a workout. So get yourself a good protein powder and get ready.</p>
